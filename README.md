# CAD-Prediction-System
Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can significantly improve survival rates and reduce treatment costs. This project implements a machine learning-based prediction system for CAD using patient data.

Abstract:--
The Coronary Artery Disease Detection System aims to provide an efficient, accurate, and non-invasive method for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD). Leveraging modern machine learning techniques and clinical datasets, the system predicts the likelihood of CAD based on patient data such as medical history, lifestyle factors, and physiological parameters. 
The project showcases the integration of healthcare knowledge with technology to enable early detection, potentially saving lives and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.

Introduction :--

The health care industries collect huge amounts of data that contain some hidden information, which is useful for making effective decisions. For providing appropriate results and making effective decisions on data, some advanced data mining techniques are used. In this study, a Heart Disease Prediction System (HDPS) is developed using Naives Bayes and Decision Tree algorithms for predicting the risk level of heart disease. The system uses medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction. The HDPS predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease. It enables significant knowledge. E.g. Relationships between medical factors related to heart disease and patterns, to be established. The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.
Problem Statement

AIM;--

To predict heart disease according to input parameter values provided by user and dataset stored in database.

Objective:--

The main objective of this project is to develop a coronary artery disease prediction system. The system can discover and extract hidden knowledge associated with diseases from a historical heart data set Heart disease prediction system aims to exploit data mining techniques on medical data set to assist in the prediction of the heart diseases.
